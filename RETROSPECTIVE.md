# Lab Retrospective Discussion
### Names
Keith Cressman

## Project's current progress
We're on track. We still haven't gotten to our additional features, but we are close to having a basic version of Uno working, with the view and backend integrated. Once we can integrate the front end and backend, we will have a basic version working. We have also done a good job of writing tests as we go. The design seems solid, but that will definitely get tested as we start adding in the additional features / games. All in all, we are on a good pace. 

## Current level of communication
We are communicating pretty well over text. We do a lot of communication in groups of 2-3 rather than the entire 5. The documentation/interfaces also help, as we can look at them to see how to use our teammates' code. 

## Satisfaction with team roles
Keith: I haven't done as much as I have with previous projects, but that will pick up as we add on the new variations/games which will require more data/parsing. 
Cate: Satisfied
Ryleigh: Satisfied
Luke: Satisfied
Alicia: Extra Satisfied

## Teamwork that worked well

* Thing #1
  * We communicate in subgroups (front end and backend) about issues concerning each others' work, without bothering teammates unaffected by the issue. 

* Thing #2
  * We communicate in our group chat as soon as we notice any issue concering the whole group. 


## Teamwork that could be improved

* Thing #1
  * Somebody pushed something with a bug in it that prevented the code from compiling, which we should avoid in the future. 

* Thing #2
  * Maybe we could meet more often

## Teamwork to improve next Sprint
We do a lot of texting but it might help if we had more meetings (in person or Zoom)
