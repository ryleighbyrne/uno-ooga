I worked with Casey G and Drew P. Casey did Monopoly, and Drew did Uno, like me (he's on a different team). 
We all had pretty similar APIs for our main work: creating an object representing the state of a game based on data in a file. 
Each of us have a pretty similar public static method that takes in something like a path to a file, and returns a Game, Model, or GameData object with the information described in the file. 
Considering that we all have nearly the same API, we agreed that we had done it well; it is pretty self-explanatory to other people, taking in a simple argument and returning an intuitive object.
