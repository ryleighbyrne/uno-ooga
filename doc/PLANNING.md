# OOGA Plan Discussion

### Team 1

## Project goals

Create a fully-integrated game of UNO that is well-designed, flexible, and open to extension.

## Project Emphasis

We want to first focus on planning out each module in detail and making sure we have a solid game
design that uses abstractions, encapsulation, inheritance, design patterns, etc. to handle future
modifications.

## Project Extensions

* Basic: setting user preferences --> user profile picture
* Mild: dynamic game rules --> custom card
* Challenging: game area editor --> users can initialize a game from a setup screen

## Project Progress

#### Sprint 1 (Test)

For the first sprint, we will focus on building out the basic components of our project in a
test-driven way to create an integrated, working version of UNO.

#### Sprint 2 (Basic)

For the second sprint, we will focus on refactoring some components as we begin to build out other
versions of UNO and flesh out more complex features of the basic implementation.

#### Sprint 3 (Complete)

For the complete submission, we will continue to build out any remaining features that are left,
think more rigorously about any use cases that might break our program, finalize our other
variations of UNO, and create more tests and data files.

## Project Roles

* Luke - viewer
* Cate - viewer
* Keith - data
* Alicia - engine
* Ryleigh - controller

## List of all features we're planning to implement

* user profile picture
* customizable basic card - mid-gameplay
* game area editor - allows for game setup from sim file and/or editing in UI
