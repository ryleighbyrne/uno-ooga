After our discussion about our APIs, I realized that there is some 
changes that can be made. Specifically after going through everything 
and outlining how our APIs worked, I see that there is repetitive method calls 
within the controllers themselves that can be changed to make the flow of our 
program easier. I also got some inspiration from the design of their API, it was 
especially interesting because they are also making UNO.
