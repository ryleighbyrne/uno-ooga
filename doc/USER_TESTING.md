# User Testing Review

## Helpful Comments / Concerns

A classmate and I were discussing whether my group was considering sending user passwords through an
encoder/decoder and that had me thinking about our program's password feature; theoretically, I can
open profiles.JSON and just copy and paste someone's password to log in. While me stealing someone's
UNO login password in no way will result in me knowing anything about them besides a username, I
still am now considering updating our password security features.

Another classmate's first response to me explaining the game area editor was "how can I break this?"
and we discovered a potential design flaw. Now, I will implement the game area editor in a way where
users can only select from options I present them, rather than inputting their own text to prevent
errors. Malicious or not, errors are more likely when dealing with user input rather than a user
choice.

## Ideas

When considering the game area editor, a classmate suggested we just add preferences to an existing
deck, rather than having a user create an entire deck from scratch.

When discussing profile picture uploads, a classmate suggested that user uploaded files go into a
folder with their username, rather than the general "private" one I had.

## Takeaways

This user feedback was helpful and provided insights that I hadn't considered when initially
designing this project. Everyone said our UI was great, though, and that made me confident in my
team's efforts as users approved of its aesthetic and logic flow.
