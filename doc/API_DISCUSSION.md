So we were not sure what exactly to discuss. Nevertheless, we brought up the following points as
being very important for writing a flexible game:

* Good separation of model and view
* Keep classes, especially base/abstract classes, very open for extension. As prof. Duvall was
  saying, try to use the notification/observer paradigm
* Avoid hard coding (even of methods/class types) when possible to avoid being stuck with a certain
  code flow, and instead allow for properties of the game to determine those things
* Avoid tight coupling of classes; try to avoid making one class dependent on the implementation in
  another class
