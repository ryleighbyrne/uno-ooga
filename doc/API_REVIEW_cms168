## API Review
### Cate Schick cms168

## Takeaways

* I worked with Katherine, who implemented Grid-based games as her final project.
* Katherine seemed to understand my Display API fairly well, and mentioned that she thought
it was well-designed and straightforward.
* I received some suggestions about removing APIS for classes I have changed to final, which
helped me re-organize my View APIs
* Katherine also commented that my API is hard to misuse as the user is notified of many
instances when things go wrong.
