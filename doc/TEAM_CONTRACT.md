# OOGA Team Contract

### Team 1 – Team Uno

### Date: 11/3/2021

## As a project team, we promise to:

* respect each other's ideas and work

* others based on your team discussion

## If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may:

# Team Procedures

## Team meetings

### When and how often to meet (at least once a week)

We will meet on zoom at least 1-2 times outside our weekly Wednesday lab.

### How to communicate action items made during the meeting

Make TO-DO lists during meetings for each team member detailing expectations of them to be completed
by the next team meeting.

### Policy for a team member to give advance notice of missing a team meeting and work required to make up for it

When we discuss the next meeting time, speak up if you are unable to attend rather than saying at
the last minute that you are unavailable. If you can’t attend the meeting, try to get the work done
before that meeting if other teammates will require that work for the meeting.

### Policy for handling disagreements, major decisions, or priorities during the meeting

Text people, talk it out, set meeting priorities at the beginning or meetings.

## Communications

### Decision-making policy (e.g., by consensus? by majority vote?)

We will try to get consensus in the group, using majority vote if needed. We will also consider who
is more in charge of implementation to have a larger voice in the matter.

### Preferred channel of communication (e.g., Zoom, e-mail, WhatsApp, Slack, etc.)

We will primarily communicate through iMessage group chat, Zoom

### Response policy (e.g., respond within 24 hours)

We will try to respond as soon as possible, if not within 12 hours.

### Policy for keeping everyone up-to-date on major decisions, changes, or updates

We will try to text in the chat whenever u merge a change, along with a description of the change if
it is significant.

## Helping each other

### How and when to ask for help and what is needed to show effort

Do work to show effort, ask for help via group message or direct message, if you are really stuck on
something or have something to discuss.

### Response to team member asking for help

We should try to respond ASAP, the person who could provide the best answer/most info should
respond.

### Ways to "go above and beyond" as needed to support the team and even other teams

Getting work done a day ahead of time would be very helpful for others relying on your code.

## Commitments

### What does it mean to work to the "best of your ability"

Try your best to complete your fair share of work before deadlines/team meetings.

### How to set internal deadlines

To do lists after each team meeting, due b4 next team meeting

### How to provide commitments others on the team can rely on

Being specific about what tasks/features each person will do.

### Policy for resolving failure to meet commitments

Explain why, maybe what you intend to do differently in the future.
