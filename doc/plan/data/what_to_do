Write any number of example data files needed to represent the simplest possible useful game.
The goal of these files is to help the team agree on standard locations and formats for your shared data
(such as property files for configurations within your Java code, your team's chosen file format for
representing game data, and other asset files like HTML pages, images, or sounds) rather than to
create a complex working game. Note, your example does not need to be exhaustive, just representative
of the file's format.
