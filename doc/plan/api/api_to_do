Write any number of Java interface types in appropriate packages, to represent your APIs.
Note, these must be Java code files that compile and contain extensive comments to explain the purpose
of each interface and each declared method (this basic code can be be generated directly from a UML diagram or
used to create a diagram). Include any Exceptions you plan to throw because of errors that might occur
 within these methods. Note, this does not require that all of these types will remain as interfaces
 in the final implementation, just that the goal is for you to focus on each type's behavior and
 purpose rather than its state.
